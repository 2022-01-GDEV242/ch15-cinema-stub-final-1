-Jake Kymer 4/26-
Whenever you update something make sure to update the @verson. the format we are going to use
is going to be initial then date. So if I were to make a change I would vhange the @version 
to say J4-26.

Next after you update the @version write what you changed below it. I know we will sum up 
what we did in our Git commits but lets make it easier for everyone else and sum it up in the code.

If there is ever anything you need us to know for the next time update this doc. make sure you check this
doc before working on the code. Just start a new paragraph and head it like i did this one; name and date.

furthermore please update the read me doc with your names under authors. 

if you ever need me imidiately im almost always on discord and will respond asap. Heres my username Spirit_Shadow#3564
